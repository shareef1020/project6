                    The Hulk is a superhero appearing in American comic books
                     published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and 
                     artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in the 
                     debut issue of The Incredible Hulk (May 1962). In his
                      comic book appearances, the character, who has dissociative
                       identity disorder (DID), is primarily represented by the alter
                        ego Hulk, a green-skinned, hulking and muscular humanoid 
                        possessing a limitless degree of physical strength, and the 
                        alter ego Dr. Robert Bruce Banner, a physically weak,
                         socially withdrawn, and emotionally reserved physicist,
                          both of whom typically resent each other.
